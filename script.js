//1. number
let age = 19 // Declaring and initializing of a variable in javascript
console.log(age) //to print
//float double negative short long are same

//2. string 
//can be within single quotes or double qoutes
let Name1 = "Aneesh"
let Name2 = "Aneesh"
//chars and string are same even special characters

console.log(Name1)
console.log(Name2)

//3. Boolean
let isTrue = true

console.log(isTrue)

//4. Type
console.log(typeof 19)          //number
console.log(typeof 19.333)      //number
console.log(typeof -123)        //number
console.log(typeof 's')         //string
console.log(typeof "string")    //string
console.log(typeof true)        //boolean
console.log(typeof null)        //object

//5. Assignment Operators
let age1 = 19
age1 = 20
console.log(age1)

const age2 = 20  //if we don't wanna change the value of var we declare the var with const data type.
age2 = 21        
console.log(age2)   //It will throw an error on the console.

age1 += 8;
age1 -= 8;
age1 *= 8;
age++ //post-increment
++age1  //pre-increment

//6. Comparison operators
//>
//<
//>=
//<=
//==

let a = 10
let b = '10'

console.log(a == b)     //It will return true   here we are just compairing the values.
console.log(a === b)    //It will return false  bcz it will check their data type as well.

//7. Arithmetic operators
//+
